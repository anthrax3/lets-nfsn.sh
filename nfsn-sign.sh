   Now add nfsn-cron.sh to your scheduled tasks so that the certificates
   will be renewed automatically.  To do that, go to

	https://members.nearlyfreespeech.net/%s/sites/%s/cron

   and use the following settings:

	Tag:                  dehydrated
	URL or Shell Command: %q
	User:                 me
	Where:                ssh
	Hour:                 %d
	Day of Week:          Every
	Date:                 *

   The certificates will be renewed only when needed so itâ€™s safe to
   schedule the task to run daily.
